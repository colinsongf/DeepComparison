# Deep Dominance - How to properly compare deep neural models

This repository contains an implementation of a method for comparing between two deep neural models.
Given two algorithms, each associated with a set of test-set scores, our goal is to determine which algorithm, 
if any, is superior. The score distributions are generated when running two different DNNs with various 
hyperparameter configurations and random seeds. This code implements a method for comparing between 
two score distributions based on a measure of "almost stochastic dominance".

Details about the implementation and theoretical justifications is described in our paper: .

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

The implementation is implemented in Python 3.6.
